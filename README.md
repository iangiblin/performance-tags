 <UL>
 <LI>Using a static list of tagged objects</LI>
 <LI>Changing the tag on every object every frame enough times to be measurably slow</LI>

This project builds to a standalone 640x480 windowed application.

Initial tests indicate that Unity Tag is very fast and my version takes about 1.7x as long.
